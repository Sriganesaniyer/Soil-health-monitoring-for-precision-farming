The process includes the following steps:
1.	Input the geographic coordinates into the GEE code.
2.	Retrieve relevant satellite data and calculate indices.
3.	Export the computed values to Google Sheets.
4.	Use Google Gemini to answer predefined questions and provide tailored farming insights, upon providing the index values.
  a.	What do the NDVI, NDWI, and BSI values for my coordinates indicate?
  b.	What are ways to improve NDVI and NDWI while reducing BSI for my location?
  c.	What specific suggestions can help improve farming practices based on the existing index values?
